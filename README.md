To run the modular, multi-file version of the project you just implemented, follow these steps on your VS Code

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

You need the `pygame` and `numpy` libraries. Open the VS Code terminal (Control + `~`) and run:

```bash
pip install pygame numpy
```

*(If you used `pygame-ce` earlier to fix the error, that is fine too).*

### Step 2: Run the Game

In the terminal, make sure you are in the folder where your files are, then run:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 5: How to Play

1.  **The Menu:** The game will start with a black screen with text options.
      * Press **`1`** on your keyboard for **Human vs AI**.
      * Press **`2`** on your keyboard for **Human vs Human**.
2.  **The Board:**
      * **Move:** Slide your mouse left/right to position your piece.
      * **Drop:** Click the left mouse button to drop the piece.
      * **Win:** If someone wins, the game announces it and closes automatically after 3 seconds.
